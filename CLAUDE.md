- all pages should be single page [no scroll unless absolutely necessary] and should get auto adjusted to height and width of the mobile device
- always use database for authentication
- pass authentication token redirect url's otherwise pages get logged out without auth token
- No use of browser sessions/cookies/localStorage since I am using iFrame1
